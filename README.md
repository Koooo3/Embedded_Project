# Embedded_Project
 
In this project, the design process for a car whose movement is controlled by an accelerometer sensor placed away from it will be discussed. An Arduino UNO will be used in order to capture the values from the accelerometer and with the help of a RF sensor, data will be transmitted from Arduino UNO to a 16F877A pic microcontroller in order to receive data using the RF sensor whose transmitter will be on the Arduino UNO board and whose receiver will be on the pic so the car’s speed and direction can be controlled. A detailed explanation of each component and sensor used in this project while showing the interfacing between all of them will be done, also, the way data is transmitted between the Arduino and the pic using a RF sensor, and the car’s control process will be shown alongside their generated codes. The circuit design for the whole project using Proteus will be added with a supporting block diagram/flow chart to summary the whole process.
